Greenhouse Gas Emission Tableau Visualization

Overview
This project provides a visualization of greenhouse gas emissions using Tableau. The objective is to explore and analyze greenhouse gas emissions data in an interactive and informative way.

Data
The data for this project is sourced from various organizations and includes information on greenhouse gas emissions by sector and country.

Technologies Used
Tableau

Steps Involved
1. Data Collection:
The greenhouse gas emissions data is collected from various sources and compiled into a single dataset.

2. Data Cleaning:
Involves removing null values, correcting errors, and transforming the data into a usable format.

3. Hypothesis Building:
Analyze the data and formulate hypotheses about the relationships between greenhouse gas emissions and various factors such as geographic location, economic activity, and population density.

4. Data Analysis:
Use Tableau to create visualizations and explore the data, testing the hypotheses formulated in the previous step.

5. Dashboard Creation:
Combine the individual visualizations into a single interactive dashboard for ease of use.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of Tableau for visualizing greenhouse gas emissions data. By following the steps outlined in this project, one can gain valuable insights into the sources and impact of greenhouse gas emissions on a global scale. The interactive dashboard allows users to explore the data in a dynamic and informative way, making it easier to understand the impact of greenhouse gas emissions and to identify potential areas for reduction. The addition of the hypothesis building step helps to guide the analysis and ensure that the data is being used effectively to address relevant questions.
